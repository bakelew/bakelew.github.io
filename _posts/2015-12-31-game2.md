lead_text: 'After completing my BSc, I co-developed a game called Ninjilante (screen cap of the user interface and storytelling). Ninjilante is a stealth game with a strong focus on timing of movement, and strategy with a challenging and unforgiving combat system (try not to be seen!). My main involvement was a large portion of Unity C# scripting, as well as the background music, and some of the sprites. If you still have Internet Explorer, see the link below for a playable web version!'
