lead_text: 'Part of my PhD thesis (2017-2020) investigated tracking and localization of almost purely rotational movement in large spaces. Localization is much simpler with a prior model of the environment. For large-scale multi-user applications such as sport spectators, this is especially important. Work in progress!'
