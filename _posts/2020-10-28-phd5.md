lead_text: 'Part of my PhD thesis (2017-2020) investigated tracking and localization of almost purely rotational movement in large spaces. Another application scenario that relates to this is casually captured panoramas. Our system CasualStereo used spherical motion constraints to compute circular trajectories from these videos to generate more immersive stereoscopic panoramas which can be viewed in VR headsets. Try the link below with a WebXR enabled mobile device browser (Chrome works nicely, but make sure to enable WebXR in chrome://flags).'
