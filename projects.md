# PhD thesis
My PhD thesis entitled Localisation and Tracking of Stationary Users for Extended Reality covered two main topics in various areas of AR and VR. Firsly, I investigated the possibility of using state-of-the-art model based pose estimation techniques for localising users in dynamic environments. I then investigated the limitations of current tracking methods when users perform movements with small translations with respect to the size of their environment. I also worked on applying these stationary tracking techniques to the problem of stereo panorama generation from casually captured video.
