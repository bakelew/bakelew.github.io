# About me

As a recent PhD graduate from the University of Otago, I am now looking for work in the VR, AR, and game development industries, or academia to apply what I have learned throughout my time at Otago, and come up with new ideas to put out into the world. I have a broad range of interests that ultimately led me to begin studying in the Department of Computer Science with a minor in Music Technology in 2012.

I have always had a passion for science and problem solving, with a creative side driven by my hobby as an average-to-poor guitar player. This drew me initially toward the graphics side of computer science, with my first project being a real-time ray tracer written in OpenCL. From here, I explored concepts of Computer Vision with my Masterâ€™s project in detecting overhead power lines from terrestrial photographs.

With experience in the fundamentals of computer graphics and vision, I began my PhD in Augmented and Virtual Reality with the hope to make a contribution in such a fast-growing research field. Under the supervision of Stefanie Zollmann, Steven Mills, Tobias Langlotz, and Jonathan Ventura, I investigated the topics of Tracking and Localization in depth within the context of Extended Reality applications.
