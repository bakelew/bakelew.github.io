# About me
![image](/img/lewis.jpg){: style="float: right; width: 25%; margin: 0.5em 1em;"}I am from Dunedin, New Zealand and studied at the University of Otago between 2012 and 2020. I have a broad range of interests that ultimately led me to begin studying Computer Science with a minor in Music Technology in 2012. I have always had a passion for science and using it to create tangible results, which drew me initially toward the graphics side of computer science with my first project being a real-time ray tracer written in OpenCL. From here, I explored concepts of computer vision with my Master's project in detecting overhead power lines from terrestrial imagery. With experience in the fundamentals of computer graphics and vision, I began my PhD in Augmented and Virtual Reality with the hope to make a contribution in such a fast-growing research field. Since completing my PhD at the end of 2020, I am now looking for work in the industry or academia to apply what I have learned throughout my time at Otago, and keep on learning.
